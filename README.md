# Genyus Network - Accessible Interface Repository

## Project Overview

Genyus Network is a global trauma survivor community and capacity-building platform. Trauma survivors from all over the world join through Genyus Network to share their stories, get support, be an example to others and become a part of this very inclusive home-like community. The Genyus Network aims to help trauma survivors and those who support them in increasing their capacity to live life after trauma. Caleb, the founder of Genyus Network, had the ambition to create a network for those who had been affected by trauma after suffering a stroke at the age of 24. Since then, it's been a thriving community.

We are team redback and will mainly be working on Aphasia friendly AI buttons.

- "Aphasia Friendly Button": A potential "alt-text" feature whereby blog authors and general posts could be given an "aphasia friendly" button that shows the simplified text. This was initially proposed as a manual task, but we will be implementing interesting NLP applications to automate this.

- "AI Driven Aphasia Friendly Button":  Further to the above point, will learn a vocabulary that users are comfortable with and use that to generate the "aphasia friendly" summaries. Might be out of scope, but very interesting.
